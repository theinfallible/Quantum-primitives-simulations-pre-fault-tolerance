# 🧠 Quantum Primitives & Simulations Before Fault Tolerance

> **Repository:** `quantum-primitives-simulations-pre-fault-tolerance`

This project explores the utility of quantum computing in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era, inspired by the [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06096-3) titled **“Evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance”**.  
It features modular simulations of quantum primitives using transverse field Ising models and related circuits built with Qiskit.
